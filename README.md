# QSharp-and-Quantum-Junk-Bits
This project is part of an on going research project in Quantum Cryptography. Q#, Microsofts .NET quantum programming simulator, is being used to model a concept called Junk Bits in Boneh and Lipton's work "Quantum Cryptanalysis of Hidden Linear Functions". The work done lead to a conclusion that the introduction of what was called "Junk Bits" led to an easier way to perform classical computations within a quantum algorithm.

The goal is to determine what other deterministic computations can be done using Junk Bits. This concept will be explored within this Visual Studios Project.
